Problem Statement -->

Convert Mandelbrot.java into a multithreaded version.

The maximum number active pixelThreads is limited by the number of processors/cores. 
The minimum number active pixelThreads should be identical to the maximum number active 
pixelThreads if possible.

Lets assume the area is 100x100 pixels, and the computer you are running your code has 
4 cores, than each core will work on a 1/4 of the:q pixel area.
