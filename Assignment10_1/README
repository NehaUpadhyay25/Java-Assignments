Problem Statement -->

Objective: Threads, Synchronization
Write a design which that simulates an elevator.
Requirements:
1.) The elevator has to serve n floors.
2.) The elevator can be called to every floor.
3.) The elevator has to serve every floor in a fair way. The use the ’Sabbath Service’ algorithm would be fine.
4.) The elevator car can only hold 300kg.
5.) People queueing up in front of the elevator weigh between 40kg and 100kg. The weight is randomly assigned.
6.) The queue on a particular floor is between 0 and k, k > 0. There is no correlation between people going to a floor, and people leaving a floor.
7.) The elevator, and people have to be simulated as individual threads.

Develop a design. 
Your design has to address the synchronization aspects of the requirements.
