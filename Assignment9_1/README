Problem Statement -->

Assume you have an array of length n. 
The array stores 3 dimensional points, the points int the array are not ordered. 
The number of points is defined via command line argument.

Design a single threaded algorithm which finds the closest pairs measured by euclidian distance. 
The pair of points can not be identical. 
Let’s assume the closest distance is d and more than one pair have the distance d to each other, 
then you have to print one pair.

Additionally design a multi threaded algorithm which finds the closest pairs measured by euclidian distance.
Let’s assume the closest distance is d and more than one pair have the distance d to each other, 
then you have to print one pair. The pair of points can not be identical. 
The maximum number active threads should be equal to the number of cores if possible.

Your program have to print out the time it takes to solve the problem for a single thread
solution and a multiple thread solution.
Your program must wok with all possible array lengths.
