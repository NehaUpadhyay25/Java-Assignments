JavaVersion.java prints out the version of the used java version. This is an output example if I execute the program:
--> Java Version: 1.8.0_91


Pikachu.java - Contains Iterative approach
Objective: Designing, implementing, and testing of a simple algorithm.
Suppose you have the following coin in your possession: 1, 2, 5, 10, 10, 25, 25, 25, 50. 
You would like to buy a Pikachu figure. A Pikachu figure costs 53 and in order to buy it, you need the exact amount. 
Can you buy it with the coins you have?
Program should only print out:yes, or no.
Question: Will your program also print out the correct answer if the price is 0?
A possible execution is:
java Pikachu.java
yes


CoinSubsets.java - Contains Recursive approach
Same as Pikachu problem


Designing, implementing, and testing of a simple algorithm.
Given is the following equation:
|f(x) - correctf(x)| < DELTA and DELTA > 0
Program uses the above equation to calculate f(0.1).


Objective: Designing, implementing, and testing of a iterative algorithm based on a recursive definition.
Given is the following recursive definition:
f(0) := 0; for n = 0; 
f(1) := 1; for n = 1; 
f(n) := 3 * f(n-1) + 7 * f(n-2); for n ≥ 2
Program which calculates f(n) for 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
