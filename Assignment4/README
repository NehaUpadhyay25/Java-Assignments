Problem Statement -->
Implement a two players battle ship game.
See here for details: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)
Your solution must read all input from the keyboard.
Requirements:
1.) You have to define at least following classes: TheGame, Player, Fleet, Ship, and Ocean
2.) Your program must reject all illegal inputs. For example, you can not put a boat on top of an other, etc.
3.) You have to use one ship of all four classes of ships. You do not have to use a submarine.
4.) Ships can not touch or overlap each other.
5.) Your program has to indicate hit, or miss.
6.) You have to declare a variable as final if possible.
7.) You have to declare a variable/method as private or protected if possible.
8.) You have to test every class carefuly.

The main method of my TheGame class looks like:
public static void main( String[] args ) {
        Ocean aOcean   = new Ocean(minRow, minColumn, maxRow, maxColumn);
        Ocean bOcean   = new Ocean(minRow, minColumn, maxRow, maxColumn);
        Player playerA = new Player (aOcean,  "player a", ’A’, ’a’ );
        Player playerB = new Player (bOcean,  "player b", ’B’, ’b’ );
        playerA.createTheFleet();
        playerB.createTheFleet();
        playerA.playGameWith(playerB);
}
