Problem Statement -->

Objective: Understanding simple classes, interfaces, generics
Implement an interface which can be used to interface a storage class, like a tree, a linked list. You interface has to use generics. In other words an implementation of this interface must compile without compiler warnings.
Your interface must at least support the following functionality
1.) Insertion of a specific object: insert
2.) Deletion of a specific object: remove
3.) Finding out if a specific object is already present: contain
4.) Answering the question how many objects are in the storage: size
5.) Returning each object stored in the storage area. This can be done with the following idea: hasNext, next
     storage.startFromBeginning();
     while ( storage.hasNext() {
       ... = storage.next();
       ...
    }
6.) Insert all object from one storage implementation to an other storage implementation: addAll
