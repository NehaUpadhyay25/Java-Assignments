Problem Statement -->

Objective: Understanding simple classes, interfaces, generics
Implement three classes based on the interface from 6.1. You can not modify the interface.
All implementations should compile without compiler warnings.
Requirements:
1.) The first implementation must store the objects in order. In other words, next must return the objects in order.
2.) Speed for finding out if an object is in the storage is the most important requirement for the second implementation.
3.) The third implementation must behave like a set.
Every class must contain a test main program.
