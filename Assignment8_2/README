Problem Statement -->

Objective: Java I/O framework.
Assuming the input file contains only the following characters: a c g t. Write a class similar to GZIPInputStream and GZIPOutputStream in order to compress files of this kind.
A snippet of your code from 8.1 might look like:
          outputStream = new DataOutputStream( new GZIPOutputStream( new FileOutputStream(file)));
The snippet for this how should look similar to:
          outputStream = new DataOutputStream( new AcgtOutputStream( new FileOutputStream(file)));
You have to implement the methods read() and write() for AcgtOutputStream. Newline can be ignored.
